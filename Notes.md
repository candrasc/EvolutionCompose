You will see booms and busts of a population with high sight and low strength, and then low sight and high strength.

- If the area is highly populated strength is important:
  - Finding food isn't based on your ability to find it. Mostly random
  - Can't flee from opponents when surrounded by others
  - Other units are a reliable source of energy to allow you to reproduce


- If area is sparcely populated then sight is important
  - Food is the main way to gain energy and reproduce
  - More area to navigate away from strong units
